# Base64 Encoder/Decoder â€“ Follow-Along from *Introduction to Zig*

This repository contains my implementation of a **Base64 encoder/decoder**, built while following **Chapter 4 â€“ Project 1** of [*Introduction to Zig*](https://pedropark99.github.io/zig-book/) by Pedro Park.  

The goal of this project is to apply Zig concepts in a practical setting, exploring bit manipulation, arrays, and string encoding.

## ðŸ“– About Chapter 4 â€“ *Building a Base64 Encoder/Decoder*  
Chapter 4 of *Introduction to Zig* guides readers through creating a Base64 encoder/decoder from scratch.  
This project helps reinforce key Zig concepts such as:  

- **Bitwise operations** for encoding and decoding  
- **Working with slices and arrays**  
- **Handling ASCII characters and padding**  
- **Writing modular functions in Zig**
